Hello, everyone! Iâ€™m excited to share with you my journey into web development. Iâ€™ve always been interested in creating things and learning new skills, but I never thought I could become a web developer until recently.

I started learning web development about six months ago, when I decided to take an online course on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I was amazed by how much I could do with just a few lines of code and some basic tools. I learned how to create web pages, style them, add interactivity and functionality, and deploy them to the internet.

I was hooked. I wanted to learn more and more. I started exploring different topics and technologies, such as responsive design, accessibility, frameworks, libraries, APIs, databases, and more. I also joined some online communities and platforms, such as Stack Overflow, CodePen, GitHub, and Medium, where I could find resources, ask questions, share my projects, and learn from others.

I realized that web development is not only a skill, but also a passion. Itâ€™s a way of expressing myself, solving problems, and creating value. Itâ€™s also a constantly evolving field that requires lifelong learning and curiosity.

Iâ€™m still a beginner, but Iâ€™m proud of how far Iâ€™ve come. Iâ€™m also looking for new opportunities and challenges. Iâ€™m open to feedback, collaboration, and mentorship. I want to improve my skills, learn new things, and contribute to the web development community.

If youâ€™re interested in web development or have any questions or suggestions for me, feel free to reach out to me. You can find me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Supriyo_iiests or email me at supriyopal.dev@gmail.com.
